## Security Notes

1. **Never commit sensitive credentials to the repository**
2. **Use environment variables for all sensitive configuration**
3. **Rotate credentials regularly**
4. **Use different credentials for development and production**

## Vercel Deployment

To set environment variables in Vercel:

1. Go to your Vercel dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Go to Settings â†’ Environment Variables
4. Add each variable with appropriate values for production

## Local Development

Create a `.env.local` file in the project root with your development values:

```
EMAIL_HOST=your-dev-smtp-server.com
EMAIL_PORT=465
EMAIL_USER=your-dev-email@domain.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=your-dev-email-password
# ... other variables
```

**Note:** The `.env.local` file is already in `.gitignore` and will not be committed to the repository.
